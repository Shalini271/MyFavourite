  <p>I enjoy reading as it's quite interesting and I get to learn about different places and cultures. It's a way to escape the drab reality of life and travel, across faraway lands, different galaxies, and strange worlds all in the safety of my bedroom. Books are like my friends, and I know that a character will always be there for me . When I'm feeling down I just slide my favourite book off the shelf and I become lost in it and I can't remember why I was even sad. My favourite author is Rick Riordan as he is an amazing writer and wrote my favourite book series. I also like the author Stephanie Myer. My favourite standalone book is The Devil's Advocate. In conclusion, I love reading and everything about it. </p>

    <p>My favourite character is Annabeth Chase, because she is a genius. She is a character from Percy Jackson, which is written by my favourite author, Rick Riordan. She is a demigod, meaning she is half-mortal and half goddess. Her father is mortal, Frederick Chase and her mother is Athena, the goddess of wisdom, crafts, arts, and battle strategy. She has a cousin called Magnus Chase, whose mother is her aunt. Like her mother, Annabeth is wise and very witty. She loves architecture and spends her free time designing new buildings or visiting national monuments. She has a soft side for those who seek knowledge and sometimes gets too philosophical.  </p>
